Alerts Overview
---------------

The alert system is designed to keep users informed about critical or important events happening in Durham Region, such as service disruptions, emergencies, or other noteworthy notifications.

### Protocol Buffers for Alerts
- **Purpose**: The alert data is extracted using a Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf) file, which provides a structured way of serializing the alert data for transmission.
- **Functionality**: When Durham Region wants to notify users about something important, the system uses ProtoBuf to encode the alert data. The alerts are then parsed and displayed to the user in the form of pop-up notifications.
  
### Pop-Up Notifications
- **User Interface**: When an important alert is received, it is shown to the user as a pop-up notification. This ensures that the user is immediately aware of any urgent information.
- **Data Delivery**: The alert system ensures that users receive the necessary information in real-time, allowing them to respond to events quickly.
